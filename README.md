## Description
This is a terminal-based calculator built using Python as my final project for CS50x. It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I also included an “about me” option that introduces who I am and why I built this project.

## Features
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Input validation
- Division by zero handling
- "About" option
- Runs in a loop until user exits

## How to Run
1. Open your terminal
2. Go to the folder where calculator.py is saved
3. Run the app using: `python calculator.py` (or `python3 calculator.py`)

## What I Learned
- How to write functions in Python
- How to interact with users through the terminal
- Handling invalid inputs and errors
- How to think like a programmer!
- Confidence to build real Python apps
